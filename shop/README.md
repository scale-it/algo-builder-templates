# Algo Builder Web DApp (Shop)

This is a React + `algob` project which serves as an app template. In this template we demonstrate usage of payment widget to trigger a purchase (in this case it would be purchasing tickets for a concert).

NOTE: Please go through `setup.md` first, you can find it [here](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder-templates/tree/master/docs/setup.md).
